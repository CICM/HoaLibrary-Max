The HoaLibrary (high order ambisonics library) is a two and three dimensional high order ambisonics processing set of externals and patches for Pure Data, Max, Faust and VST. It allows you to synthesize, transform and modulate sound fields.
It has been elaborated to facilitate the use of the circular and spherical harmonics and the routing in the ambisonic domain for musicians and composers.
